# Principal Component Analysis Folder - Overview
* Case Study completed by Adam M. Lang - Springboard Data Science Fellow
* Date: 5/8/2024
* This contains a case study project that I completed using various clustering algorithms along with Principal Component Analysis.
* The task was to utilize a dataset of customer reviews of different types of wine from various regions and segment them into clusters based on various features.
* The analysis involved using the following algorithms:
    1. KMeans clustering - Elbow sum of squares
    2. Calinski-Harabasz Index
    3. Silhouette Method
    4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    5. Affinity Propagation
    6. Spectral Clustering
    7. Agglomerative Clustering 
    8. DBSCAN
* There is a 2nd notebook that I completed on 5/9/2024 that includes a more in depth business case analysis of Wine styles (red, white, sparkling) and the customer segmentation of each type with business recommendations for future wine investment.
