# RR Diner Coffee Case Study
* This is a case study using Decision Trees and a comparison to a Random Forest model.
* Scenario: You have been hired by a rising popular specialty coffee company - RR Diner Coffee - as a data scientist.
* RR Diner Coffee typically buys coffee from farmers, processes it on site, brings it back to the USA, roasts it, packages it, markets it, and ships it (only in bulk, and after quality assurance) to customers internationally. These customers all own coffee shops in major cities like New York, Paris, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Berlin. Now, RR Diner Coffee has a decision about whether to strike a deal with a legendary coffee farm (known as the Hidden Farm) in rural China: there are rumours their coffee tastes of lychee and dark chocolate, while also being as sweet as apple juice.
* The task is to help RR Diner Coffee Company predict based on survey data if their customers will buy this new coffee or not.
