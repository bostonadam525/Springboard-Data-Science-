# Data Storytelling
* By Adam Lang, Springboard Data Science Fellow
* In this folder are projects related to "data storytelling": taking a dataset, performing EDA, and telling a story based off the analytical findings. 

* Prior Authorization is a major pain point of optimal healthcare delivery for both providers and patients. Whether you are a provider or a patient, you have probably experienced this before: a patient goes to have their prescription filled and it is denied due to “need for prior authorization”. Or a provider is unable to get an imaging study or test approved due to “need for prior authorization.” Insurance companies have the upper hand in this guessing game of what seems like “russian roulette”. No two similar cases are often the same in terms of what factors led to their approval, nor the time it took to get it approved. The process of prior authorization is time consuming for providers and patients, and complicates medical decision making and optimal care delivery (Berg, 2023).

* For this Data Storytelling project, I am going to utilize the open access dataset from Health.gov published by the State of Washington. This includes information on billing codes, diagnosis, service, doctors description, prior authorization approval rate, timing, number of requests, drugs prescribed by type and class and more.

* Ultimately this information can help providers, patients, and healthcare organizations in using a data-driven approach to navigating the prior authorization process.

## Dataset Details
* In 2020, the Washington State Legislature enacted Engrossed Substitute Senate Bill (ESSB) 6404 (Chapter 316, Laws of 2020, codified at RCW 48.43.0161), which requires that health carriers with at least one percent of the market share in Washington State annually report certain aggregated and de-identified data related to prior authorization to the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC). Prior authorization is a utilization review tool used by carriers to review the medical necessity of requested health care services for specific health plan enrollees. Carriers choose the services that are subject to prior authorization review. This dataset was obtained from HealthData.gov.
