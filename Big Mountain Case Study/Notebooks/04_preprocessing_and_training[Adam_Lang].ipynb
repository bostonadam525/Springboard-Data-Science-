        "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

        "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

        "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

As expected, this produced an $R^2$ of zero for both the training and test set, because $R^2$ tells us how much of the variance you're explaining beyond that of using just the mean, and you were using just the mean. Here we see that our simple linear regression model explains over 80% of the variance on the train set and over 70% on the test set. Clearly you are onto something, although the much lower value for the test set suggests you're overfitting somewhat. This isn't a surprise as you've made no effort to select a parsimonious set of features or deal with multicollinearity in our data."

If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

        "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that.

        "In this notebook we continued with the same Data Science project to establish a new lift ticket pricing model for “Big Mountain Ski Resort”. This part of the process involved data pre-processing splitting the data into a 70/30 train/test split, performing an an initial price prediction using a `DummyRegressor` model on the dataset mean, and then building 2 machine learning models, a linear regression and a random forest classifier.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did.\n",
        "  * I started by using the dataset mean as a predictor of lift ticket price. This was implemented using the sklearn `DummyRegressor`. The baseline prediction told me I would be off by about `$19` if I guessed the ticket price based strictly on mean values.\n",
        "2. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found.\n",
        "  * I then pre-processed the training data by imputing the dataset median in place of missing values. I then built a linear regression model which estimated a ticket price of `$9` within the real price, so some improvement was seen. I then imputed the mean instead of the median for missing values. This model performed worse than the median imputed model.\n",
        "3. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate.\n",
        "  * Cross validation showed that a k value of 8 is sufficient for training the model with good results, past that the variance in results significantly increases.\n",
        "  * Vertical drop was the most important feature followed by snow making acreage and total number of chair lifts, fastQuads, and Runs. The most surprising finding was that Trams and amount of skiable terrain were negatively associated with ticket price suggesting that larger resorts can lower their ticket price by accommodating more skiers.\n",
        "4. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that.\n",
        "  * A random forest regression model was built by imputing the median which was based on the better results of imputing the median with the linear regression model.\n",
        "  * It was found for the this model that imputing the median works well, but scaling the features did not.\n",
        "The top 5 most important features found via random forest were: fastQuads, Runs, snow making acreage, and vertical drop. Trams was the least important of all the features.\n",

The random forest model should give us more accurate lift ticket price prediction and better interpretation and comparison of the independent features/variable weighted importance for predicting ticket price. I also did a data quantity assessment via cross-validation and found that a sample size of 40 to 50 is sufficient before the model performance levels off.\n"
