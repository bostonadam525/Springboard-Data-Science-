* This folder is supplementary work that I did as part of the Data Science Fellowship at Springboard.
* One folder is the work that I did as part of 2 udemy courses I took on using PyTorch for Deep Learning for medical image analysis taught by Jose Portilla along with some of my own experiments.
* Another folder has some side projects/experiments I did using image analysis techniques and neural networks in PyTorch to predict labels, classify and perform other common tasks on Medical Images.
* My Capstone 2 project will be looking at Ultrasound Image Analysis and this work was done in preparation for that project.
